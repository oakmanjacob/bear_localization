# Lets Localize some BEARS!!
Jacob Oakman

Important: Data is not pulled live from the databased but is instead pulled from local JSON files so uhhh, it may be out of date
We also only pulled data for Ursus

## How to run
Just use python3 and hope for the best

```
$>python3 main.py
```

Results will be placed into the results.json file

## Special Thanks
The Federal Government for hooking us up with a cool county API.
